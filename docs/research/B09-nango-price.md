Can you add support for more APIs?

Yes, we can add support for any public API or MCP server.
[Please follow this guide](https://nango.dev/docs/integrations/contribute-or-request-api).

If you have a test account for the API, we can also add pre-built tool calls & syncs for it.

Turnaround times depend on your plan and can be as low as 2 days for Enterprise customers.

What are Connections, Function compute time, and Data Transfer?

**1 Connection =** 1 API key or access token of the external API. For example:
3 users connect their Gmail = 3 connections.

Connections are pro-rated for the time they are stored in your account.

**Function compute time** measures how long your integrations run. Each run is
rounded up to the nearest second.

For example, if a tool call takes 300ms, you will be billed for 1 second of Function compute time. A sync
that runs once an hour and takes 3 seconds per run consumes 24 x 3 = 72 seconds of compute time per day.

Tool calls, syncs, and actions consume function compute time.

**Data Transfer** measures the amount of data Nango processes for your integrations.
This includes:

- Data sent from Nango to your backend
- Data sent from Nango to external APIs
- Data processed by Nango’s syncs
- Custom log messages you emit from your Nango Functions

We only measure egress. Ingress transfers are free.

Do you offer volume discounts?

We offer significant volume discounts, with commitments, across all pricing metrics on the Enterprise plan.

For example, connections can be as low as $0.01/connection/month at scale.

[Please reach out](https://nango.dev/contact) with your expected volumes for a custom quote!

Is Nango suitable for high-volume use cases?

Yes, definitely. We serve B2C and Fortune 500 companies. Our platform is built for high throughput, and all
components scale horizontally.

On the commercial side, we offer volume discounts on the Enterprise plan.
[Please reach out](https://nango.dev/contact) for a custom quote!

Does Nango offer an EU-hosted cloud?

We currently don’t have an EU cloud, but are considering this for the future. Meanwhile we offer BYOC
instances in any AWS, GCP or Azure region on the Enterprise plan.

How can I track my usage? Can I set spend alerts?

Your Nango dashboard has a
[detailed breakdown of your usage](https://app.nango.dev/team/billing).

You can also set up spend alerts.
